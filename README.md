# Digenic

Instructions on how to use Rscripts are available on the Rscripts themselves. 
Scripts were developed so to be used with double loop parallelisation. 
However, it is recommended to follow the advice of manual parallelization as stated in the scripts. 
Detail information is expected to be available in the near future as well as updated scripts.


# General information

Scripts were developed to perform digenic analyses. The script example is shown for gene x gene interaction analyses. However, gene x variant is as straightforward as gene x gene interaction tests using these scripts. 
For gene x gene interaction tests, the general idea is to aggregate variant information at the gene level and assess unexpected high correlation between carriers of variants of two different genes. The test in conducted under a case-only framework which provides the advantage of rely exclusively on the absence of population stratification and linkage disequilibrium to assess true interactions.
